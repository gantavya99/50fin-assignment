50Fin Users
50Fin Users is a React app that fetches user information from a public API and displays it. The app allows users to search for users based on their name or email. Additionally, users have the option to add new users to the app. The app follows the theme of the 50Fin company's website and utilizes styled components for the Button component, while regular CSS styling is used for other components. The app is organized with proper modularization and folder structure to ensure maintainability and scalability.
